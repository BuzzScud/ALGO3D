2. **libcrawler** - Web crawling and continuous training
   - Autonomous web crawling with rate limiting
   - HTML preprocessing and text extraction
   - Tokenization pipeline
   - Continuous model training

### Applications

1. **cllm_crawler** - Command-line crawler tool
   - Pure consumer of libcrawler.so
   - Autonomous web crawling
   - Real-time status updates

2. **hyper_prime_spiral** - Interactive GUI application
   - Pure consumer of libcrawler.so and libprimemath
   - Prime spiral visualization
   - CLLM training interface
   - Research tools

## Architecture

The project follows proper library architecture with complete independence between components:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    libcrawler.so                            │
│  (Shared library - provides all crawler functionality)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ▲                        ▲
                    │                        │
        ┌───────────┴──────────┐   ┌────────┴──────────┐
        │   cllm_crawler       │   │  hyper_prime_spiral│
        │   (CLI tool)         │   │  (GUI app)         │
        │  100% independent    │   │  100% independent  │
        └──────────────────────┘   └────────────────────┘
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Contributing

This project follows strict architectural principles:

1. **Library Independence**: Each library must be self-contained
2. **Consumer Independence**: CLI and GUI must have no shared code
3. **Clean APIs**: All public APIs must be well-documented
4. **Thread Safety**: All library functions must be thread-safe
5. **No Coupling**: Components must not depend on implementation details
